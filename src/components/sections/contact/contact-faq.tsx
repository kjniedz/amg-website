    question: "Who is AMG designed for?",
    answer:
      "AMG serves UHNW families ($100M+ net worth), family offices ($250M+ AUM), and global executives who face complex, multi-domain threats and need integrated protection.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the discovery process work?",
    answer:
      "We begin with a confidential conversation to understand your situation. From there, we conduct a comprehensive cross-domain assessment and deliver a unified strategic blueprint.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes AMG different from traditional security firms?",
    answer:
      "Traditional firms address one domain in isolation. AMG integrates five domains \u2014 neurobiology, cybersecurity, leadership, medicine, and intelligence \u2014 under one strategic layer.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an engagement typically take?",
    answer:
      "Initial discovery and blueprint development takes 4-6 weeks. Ongoing support is continuous and adapts to your evolving needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my information kept confidential?",
    answer:
      "Absolute discretion is foundational to everything we do. All communications and client information are protected under strict confidentiality protocols.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we start with just one domain?",
    answer:
      "Yes. While our integrated approach is most powerful, clients can begin with two or more domains and expand as needs evolve.",
