1. Run quality checks:
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint -- --fix
   npm run build
   Fix ALL errors before continuing.

2. Review changes: run `git status` and `git diff --staged` and `git diff`

3. Stage relevant files with `git add` (specific files, not -A)

4. Generate a commit message:
   - Start with verb (Add/Update/Fix/Remove/Refactor)
   - Be specific and concise, one line preferred
